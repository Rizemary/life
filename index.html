Not passively, but with a heart that kept beating louder every time I thought of the moment I was longing for. Five years of wondering, will it come, will I be ready. I held on through every storm, every silent goodbye, and every sleepless night filled with the kind of hope that hurts. I imagined that moment a thousand different ways. How I would smile. How my voice would sound. How the world would finally feel like it made sense. But when it came, when it finally came, I broke. I hesitated. I said the wrong things. I let fear wear my face and silence hold my tongue. And just like that, what I had waited for, what I had built my dreams around, slipped away quiet and cold like sand falling through open fingers.<p>Now I live in the shadow of that moment, replaying it again and again, each time rewriting it in my head the way I wish it had gone. The regret clings to me like a second skin. I curse myself for not being stronger, for not speaking up, for not doing the one thing I had five years to prepare for. And sometimes, the pain hits me in waves, so heavy that I can’t breathe. I would give anything, anything to go back, to relive that moment, to not be the version of me that failed. I wonder if the universe saw my heart shake, if it knows I didn’t mean to ruin it.<p>And now, what haunts me the most is not just the mistake, but the silence that follows. The not knowing. The unbearable thought that maybe chances like that only come once. I keep asking myself the same question, over and over again. Will life ever be kind enough to offer me that same chance again? Or was that it, the one golden hour I waited five years for, only to lose it in a breath I can't take back.</p><br><p>~ best regards, anonym.</p><script>function toggleMode() {
